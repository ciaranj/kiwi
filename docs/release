    kiwi release <name> <version>
    
  Description:
  
    Releases seed <name> and <version> to the kiwi
    server. In order to do so you must be the owner
    of this seed.
    
    Essentially this is a shortcut for both building
    then publishing your seed.
    
  Examples:
    
    From within the root directory of your project:
