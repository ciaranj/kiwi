# Kiwi

  JavaScript package management system for node.js
  
## Features

  * Fast / Solid
    - Written in bash script
    - Utilizes battle-tested programs
  * Packaging of "seeds" (tarballs)
    - Ignores .{git,svn,cvs}
    - Ignores globs in .ignore when packing
  * Distributed packages as "seeds"
    - installation (including node and kiwi itself)
    - uninstallation
    - updating
    - publishing to the kiwi seed server (similar to gemcutter for RubyGems)
    - listing of installed seeds and their versions
    - searching of remote seeds
    - arbitrary build commands (so you can make, scons, jake, etc)
    - installation via flat-list of seeds and associated versions
    - collects stats such as seed download counts
    - user registration via command-line
    - user authentication
  * Version resolution
    - via installation
    - via runtime
  * Interactive console or REPL
    - Auto-detects and utilizes rlwrap
  * Multiple environments
    - Use one or more environments to manage your seeds
  * Not dependant on GIT (like most other proposed node package managers)
  
## Installation

    $ [sudo] make install

## Uninstallation

    $ [sudo] make uninstall
    
## Updating 

    $ [sudo] kiwi update
    
## Example Walkthrough

First we need to install a few seeds:
    $ kiwi -v install haml
    $ kiwi -v install oo
    
Now we can create a file named _app.js_ anywhere
on our system and add:

    var kiwi = require('kiwi'),
        sys = require('sys')
    
    sys.p(kiwi.require('haml', '= 0.1.2'))
    sys.p(kiwi.require('oo', '1.2.0'))
    sys.p(kiwi.require('oo'))
    
Then run it with node:
    $ node app.js

## Testing

Specs are run using Ruby RSpec's `spec` executable.
  
    $ make server-start && make test && make server-stop
    
## Dependencies

Command dependencies are as follows:

  * sed
  * awk
  * tar
  * egrep
  
Currently tested with:
  
  * MacOS 1.5.8
  * GNU bash, version 3.2.17(1)-release (i386-apple-darwin9.0)
  * tar (GNU tar) 1.15.1
  * curl 7.16.3
  * egrep (GNU grep) 2.5.1
